weather_keywords = ["weather", "temperature", "forecast", "climate", "rain", "sunny", "cloudy"]
is_weather_request = any(keyword in user_input.lower() for keyword in weather_keywords)

# Search keywords detection  
search_keywords = ["search", "find", "look up", "what is", "who is", "tell me about"]
is_search_request = any(keyword in user_input.lower() for keyword in search_keywords)
```

#### Persona-Specific Dual Responses:
