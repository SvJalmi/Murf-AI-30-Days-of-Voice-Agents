### Web Search Implementation

#### Search Flow:
1. User enters search query in web interface
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/search` endpoint
3. Backend processes query through `web_search()` method
4. Search results formatted with current persona styling
5. Text-to-speech generation with persona-specific patterns
6. Audio file returned to frontend for playback
7. Search results displayed in output area

#### Persona-Specific Search Responses:

**Captain Blackbeard (Pirate):**
```
"Ahoy! I've sailed the digital seas and found this treasure of information: [search results]"
```

**Sheriff Jake (Cowboy):**
```
"Well partner, I've rounded up some information for ya: [search results]"
```

**ARIA-7 (Robot):**
```
"Search protocol executed. Data retrieved: [search results]"
```

**Merlin the Wise (Wizard):**
```
"The mystical web has revealed these secrets: [search results]"
```

**Inspector Holmes (Detective):**
```
"My investigation has uncovered the following evidence: [search results]"
```
